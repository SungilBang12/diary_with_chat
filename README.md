# Diary Chatbot Project

## Project Purpose

### Problem Recognition
Many people write diaries but often fail to revisit and utilize what they have written. Even as valuable personal data accumulates over time, it remains underutilized for personal growth and development.

The main causes of this phenomenon include:
* **Psychological resistance**: The burden of reflecting on past emotions and thoughts
* **Time constraints**: Lack of time to review and reflect on diary entries in busy daily life
* **Lack of structure**: Difficulty in systematic analysis due to unstructured emotional writing

### Solution
This project aims to solve these problems through a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) based chatbot**.

#### Core Features
1. **Psychological burden reduction**: Natural conversations with the chatbot enable comfortable reflection on past diary content.

2. **Time efficiency**: Instead of manually searching and reading diary entries, users can quickly obtain needed information by asking the chatbot.

3. **Structured diary writing**:
   * Automatically suggest diary formats based on daily emotions and energy levels
   * Provide a collaborative diary writing experience with LLM assistance

4. **Personal growth support**:
   * Analyze diary content to identify areas for improvement
   * Integration with external tools through MCP (Model Context Protocol)
   * Support gradual goal achievement through reminder systems

### Expected Benefits
* Elimination of psychological barriers to diary writing and reflection
* Enhanced self-reflection through effective utilization of personal data
* Provision of systematic and structured emotional management and personal growth tools
* Support for sustainable self-development habit formation
